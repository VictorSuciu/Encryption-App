# Encryption-App
This is a simple image encryption tool that can encrypt and decrypt images with a key/password, created in 2017. Any image that has been encrypted with a key can only be decrypted with the same key.

## Usage

1. Click the `Choose a File` button at the top, and select the image file you want to use. </br> **This must be a png file. jpg or others will not work.**

2. Enter the key you would like to use. A key can be any string of characters of any length such as a word or sentence, and can include letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters. If you are decrypting an image that was encrypted with this tool, enter the same key that was used to encrypt it.

3. Encrypt or decrypt the image. If you are encrypting the image, both the `Shift Up` and `Shift Down` buttons will work. If you are decrypting the image, you must use the opposite button to what it was encrypted with.

4. The image will remain in the same place on your computer as before it was altered by the app.
