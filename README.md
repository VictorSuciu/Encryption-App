# Encryption-App
This is a simple image encryption tool that can encrypt and decrypt images with a key/password, created in grade 11. A key can be any string of characters of any length such as a word or sentence, and can include letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters. Any image that has been encrypted with a key can only be decrypted with the same key.
